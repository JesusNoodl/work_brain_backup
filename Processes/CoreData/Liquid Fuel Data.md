The burning of liquid fuels is BAM UK&I’s largest Scope 1&2 emissions source and is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels. Like most emissions categories there a a number of sources the data comes from:
- Supplier reports
	- In both the UK and Ireland a few fuel suppliers have monopolies on the market meaning from only a few supplier reports we can cover the vast majority of directly procured fuels. Fuel suppliers send monthly Excel reports through a representative and it is key to keep in touch with that representative as they can forget to send the reports. On the other hand fuel suppliers may send automatic reports although this is unlikely.
- Invoice data
	- Although these large fuel suppliers have monopolies on the market some projects will procure through local suppliers. To identify these a keyword search in the respective invoicing system will be used. On a usual month only a couple of invoices will come through so it is always a low admin burden.
- JVs
	- On most JVs BAM are not lead procurement therefore to receive supplier reports approval needs to be given by someone on the project to the supplier. We will always strive to collect the fuel reports from the supplier as we will already be receiving reports from them so adding the JVs data is an efficient process. 
- Subcontractor procured fuel
	- Currently data on subcontractor procured fuel is patchy across the UK&I; the construction segment is the only segment that require subcontractor to report this fuel use through their [[site reporting tool]]. This data is a requirement for our [[Net Zero 2026]] target and [[CSRD]].

Carbon factors for fuel are solely dependent on the factors supplied by the UK Gov department of the Department of Energy Security & Net Zero. Although Ireland have their own government department that supplies electricity emissions factors they do not supply fuel emissions factor’s therefore the UK factors are used in instead.
