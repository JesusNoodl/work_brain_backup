## Notes

- [File Naming Conventions July 2017.pdf (abdn.ac.uk)](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/documents/policy-zone-information-policies/File%20Naming%20Conventions%20July%202017.pdf "https://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/documents/policy-zone-information-policies/File%20Naming%20Conventions%20July%202017.pdf") - good resource we can just use a re-write for a naming convention. Also try not to use spaces were possible. Use camel text, underscores or dashes.
