## Notes

### First impressions and user experience

Elaine
- Q3 which organisation instigated the inactivates needs to be multi pick
- technical issue Q15 couldn't progress
Anthony

- Mandatory fields causing issues
- Questions are quite construction focused

Gaelle
- Tested by non-sustainability experts
- The jargon can be hard to understand
	- Productivity benefit was a difficult
- Save response needs to be in guidance
Ana Dabes

### Outputs and technical automation

One pager PDF to export when the form is submitted "Case Study Lite"
Speak with Alison regarding tagging
Monthly email for the specialist, seniors, BP
Files can be too large and too many for the upload so needed in guidance

### Driving adoption of the form i.e. BAMSI

- BAMSI is a must to make sure projects interact. ESIR is primary but people can still use the good practice portal and BIM360.
	- Make sure to communicate to projects it does not have to be above and beyond but just something good. This can be done in the video and guidance.
- Using the advisor visit to prompt people to fill in the form, Eamon to be included in this discussion.

### Communication and training/guidance

- Having a poster to be places in projects and site cabins
- Video made by Max and Sarah
- Comms package
- Engagement forum to talk about the form
- Stats about how many forms have been submitted
- Thinking about a awards 
- Keep the guidance simple for people on site (efficient)
- Resource's can be tight when going back to a project to create a glossy 
- Using the WWH to promote the forms
- Utilising Yammer to promote some of the ESIR forms that has been submitted
