- 3-4 min piece about the E.S.E form
- Carbon reduction plan to talk about some case studies
- New tech and adoption - HVO, we are trying adopt as quickly as we can but they are always expensive. (What have they seen for the cost of these new technologies in their bids? What is the scale for different technologies(Concrete vs gens vs ...))
- 1-2 slides about calculating carbon, activity data, carbon factors, scope
- 1 slide on CANDY and how it works, its quirks, difference between CANDY carbon and Embodied carbon assessment (end of the project), what we planned to build and what actually was built. What does CANDY carbon tell us (A1-A5).
- 1 Slide on support - org chart - we have a new structure, BPs and Specialists (Blue) support tender but the seniors will also be able to help. Bespoke items

- Kevins Topics
	- A very brief introduction to / reminder of BAMâ€™s sustainability objectives, and why it is important
	- Some interesting project case studies with plenty of photos of sustainable initiatives (renewable energy, carbon and waste reduction, hydrogen and electric plant etc.).
	- An insight into where we are in terms of adoption on sites and availability of new technology, plant and equipment, and indicative costs
	- Carbon measurement in estimates (Max, supported by Ala from our team?)
	- The support you can provide at tender stage
	- Key pre-construction contacts and the BAM Sustainability team
## Actions

- Speak to Amanda about a case study for waste reduction (in presentation say to estimators that it is difficult due to the work we do. Mainly focused at wood waste)
