## Agenda/Questions
1. Introductions and what data we work on
2. What would we like to get from this community? 
3. Do we see a benefit of having a high-level sponsor
4. How will this community co-exist with the team under Katarina
5. Who should be able to join the community
6. How often should we meet virtually/in-person

## Notes
- A community where we can help each other with technical questions as line managers/people we work closely with (sometimes) don’t have the knowledge to help.
- Having a permanent teams chat to ask each other question
- Speak to Katarina about using the Data Analytic DPS SharePoint
- Having a sponsor, maybe wait until the Data Scientist joins the DPS
- In the interim have Katarina as a sponsor and update the group on what is going on in the DPS world. Mainly for Max and Khadija's benefit of the bigger picture.
- DPS catchup calls with Katarina are more business updates and DPS updates and not technical. The community calls with be more technical focused instead.
- We do not want to community to become too big as it will make it could make it too formal but this group will naturally expand as more data analyst join the business.
- Guest speakers as a topic point for the first meeting
- Calls can be once a month for about 1 hour on a Friday afternoon.
- In the future we can organise an in person meeting, maybe combining it with an event.
